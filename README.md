# Tech-Salary-Prediction

# The Project:
This project attempts to use machine learning algorithms to predict an induviduals salary based on variables such as their experience, their company, how long they have been working at the company and more. 

# Data
Type: CSV
Input: Employees and thier personal attributes
Size: 41000 employees and 9 variables


# The Data Set
- The Data is collegected from Kaggle and is then preprocessed. The null values were removed and the data set was cleaned by removing any outlieres from each variable. Then data transformation was taken place, making sure the dataset had the proper columns, changing the variables into binarys. This file also contains some data modeling and a small attempt at a linear regression model.
